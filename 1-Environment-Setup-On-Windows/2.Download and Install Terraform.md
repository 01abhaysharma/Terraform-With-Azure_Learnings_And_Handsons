# Steps to Download Terraform on a Windows System

## Download the Appropriate Package for Your System
Visit the Terraform [downloads page](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html). Click on the download link for 'Windows (64-bit)' or 'Windows (32-bit)' based on your operating system's architecture.

## Extract the Package
The download is a ZIP archive. You will need to extract it. You can use built-in Windows tools or a program like 7-Zip. Right-click on the downloaded ZIP file, choose "Extract all...", and then decide on a destination folder for the Terraform binary.

## Add Terraform to Your Systemâ€™s PATH
To make the Terraform command readily available, you need to add it to your system's PATH environment variable. Here's how to do it:
1. Right-click on 'This PC' or 'My Computer' and choose 'Properties'.
2. Click on 'Advanced system settings'.
3. In the System Properties window that appears, click on the 'Environment Variables' button.
4. In the 'System variables' section, scroll down and select the 'Path' variable, then click 'Edit'.
5. In the Edit Environment Variable window, click 'New' and add the path to the directory where you extracted the Terraform binary. For example, if you extracted the binary to C:\tools\terraform, you would add that path here.
6. Click 'OK' to close all windows. You may need to restart any open command prompt windows for the new PATH variable to be recognized.

## Verify the Installation
Open a new command prompt and enter the command `terraform`. You should see a list of available Terraform commands, which confirms that Terraform has been successfully installed and added to your PATH.
